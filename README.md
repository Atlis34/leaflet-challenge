Module 15 Challenge Assignment

Leaflet - Earthquake map plotting challenge - Module 15

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All code was written by myself, Ryan MacFarlane - using Visual Studio Code.  Help and Guidance, and double checking of syntax was provided by the Xpert Learning Assistant on the BCS website.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also placed the logic.js in both the static folder (where it was run, as well as where the index.html is pointing to), but I also placed a copy within the 'Leaflet-Part-1' folder as requested by the exercise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any questions, or any trouble running the script - please reach out to me at atlis34@yahoo.com.  Also, in the interest of time, and getting caught up as best I can, I decided not to do additional plots because that portion was unscored anyway and I need to make best use of my time.  Thank you.

Thank you for grading!
